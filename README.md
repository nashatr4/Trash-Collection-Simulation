# Trash Collection Simulation ðŸš®
This model simulates trash collection in each Faculty of Engineering UGM department. In this modeling, the Agent-Based Modeling method is used. Agent-based modeling is commonly used to study interactions between people, objects, places, and time. This is a stochastic model built from the bottom up, meaning that each agent will be given certain attributes.

## Library and Code
This modeling uses the Mesa library because Mesa is a Python library that is usually used for agent-based modeling. The code in this simulation is divided into three, namely Agent (contains the definition of the agent used), model (contains department and trash coordinates), and server (plays a role in creating simulation visualizations).

## Roadmap
  1. Install mesa library with **"pip install mesa"**
  2. Set the port you want to use, in this model the port used is **8521**. The port functions to display the simulation process on localhost
  3. Make sure all three files are in one folder
  4. Run code from the **server.py** file to display the simulation
